# The Logger Adapter
Loggers are a tricky thing in libraries and reusable software.  If one defines a specific logger, one can create 
logging related headaches for users of the system.  Different patterns exist to solve for this; the Logger Adapter 
is @franzzemen's pattern.

Essentially the Logger Adapter provides a standard interface within @franzzemen software to perform logging, leaving 
the physical logger to the user of the library, by way of configuration.  Thus one can use any logger under the 
covers, including the one for their own software, and configure the @franzzemen logger adapter to play nice.  This 
can include console loggers, AWS Cloudwatch loggers, any of the many Javascript logger libraries and so on.  You 
could create SNS or SQS based logger, **and not change a line of code**.

To create a new logger implementation for the adapter, simply implement the LoggerI interface and configure your 
logger appropriately (and provide that configuration to @franzzemen libraries by way of the[Execution Context](../execution-context.md))

    interface LoggerI {
        error(err, ...params);
        // In the following, data can be an object to log, or a string
        warn(data, message?: string, ...params);
        info(data, message?: string, ...params);
        debug(data, message?: string, ...params);
        trace(data, message?: string, ...params);
    }

The default actual logger supplied is, of course, the native logger which simply implement the console functions:


    class NativeLogger implements LoggerI {
    
        error(err, stacktrace?: any, color: string = FgRed) {
            console.error(color, err, stacktrace);
        }
        
        warn(data, message?: string, color: string = FgYellow) {
            console.warn(color, data, message);
        }
        
        info(data, message?: string, color: string = FgGreen) {
            console.info(color, data, message);
        }
        
        debug(data, message?: string, color: string = FgCyan) {
            console.debug(color, data, message);
        }
        
        trace(data, message?: string, color: string = FgMagenta) {
            console.trace(color, data, message);
        }       
    }
    
@franzzemen/cloudwatch-logs provides an implementation for AWS Cloudwatch logging.  The package is currently under 
private visibility - contact @franzzemen to inquire as to getting access.

Underneath the covers in the @franzzemen libraries, the class Index is created anywhere logging is necessary.
It's function is to:

- Properly load and use logging configuration
- Instantiate the appropriate logger implementation
- Log data/messages/errors according to logging levels, including override configurations
- Log reference information

You are free to use the Index in your own code if you find it of use - it is quite stable.  If no logger is 
supplied in the configuration, the NativeLogger (console) will be used.

Note:  At this time @franzzemen uses the Index, which populates additional useful information in the logs 
regardless of logging implementation.  Many of those are overridable in the configuration if you want to have 
"clean" logs.

The LoggerAdapater is meant to be instantiated anywhere logs are needed, typically in each method (although in some 
cases @franzzemen instantiates a Index for an entire class).  Through configs, one can override the 
Index instance behavior for a specific method.

If you do choose to reuse the Logger Adapter, creating it is simple:

    constructor(private execContext?: ExecutionContextI, public repo = '', public sourceFile = '',  public _method = '')

    where:
        execContext: is an ** optiontal ** Exeuction Context (NativeLogger/console used if undefined)
        repo: is intended to be the name of the repository, for instance '@franzzemen/re-expression'
        sourcefile: is intended to be the name (no extension) of the source file logging is occuring in
        _method: is intended to bhe the name of the method where logging is occuring

Once created you can call its convenience methods.  Under the covers, it ulimately calls whatever logging 
implementation you provided (or NativeLogger/console otherwise).

    error(err, stacktrace?: any, color: string = FgRed)
    warn(data, message?: string, color: string = FgYellow)
    info(data, message?: string, color: string = FgGreen)
    debug(data, message?: string, color: string = FgCyan)
    trace(data, message?: string, color: string = FgMagenta) 

The color is optional, and works only with the console logger, but feel free to use it for your own logger implementations.

## Configuration
The logging configuration for the Index is passed through @franzzemen libraries through the Execution 
Context as described above.

The Execution Context has an optional property "config.log", with the schema being defined in 'logger-config.ts', 
using the notation from the "fastest-validator" third party OSS package.  The contents of that configuration is 
described here:

    export interface LogConfigI {
        // If present, loads the logger implementation pointed to by ModuleDefinition
        loggerModule?: ModuleDefinition;
        // The log level to log.  Available levels are 'none', 'error', 'warn','info', 'debug' and 'trace'
        level?: string;
        // The object depth to log when logging object properties
        depth?: number;
        // Whether node's inspect method should show hidden attributes
        showHidden?: boolean;
        // Logging overrides
        overrides?: LogOverrideConfigI[];
        // The log attributes are 'flattened' into a single line, not logged as an object along with the data
        flatten?: boolean;
        // The log attributes logging flags
        logAttributes?: {
        // If true or missing, logs the appContext from the Execution Context
        hideAppContext?: boolean,
        // If true or missing, logs the repo supplied to the LoggingAdapter constructor
        hideRepo?: boolean,
        // If true or missing, logs the source file supplied to the LoggingAdapter constructor
        hideSourceFile?: boolean,
        // If true or missing, logs the method supplied to the LoggingAdapter constructor
        hideMethod?: boolean,
        // If true or missing, logs thread from the Execution Context
        hideThread?: boolean,
        // If true or missing, logs requestId from the Execution Context
        hideRequestId?: boolean,
        // If true or missing, logs the debug level
        hideLevel?: boolean
    }

The LogOverrideConfig array provides the ability to override logging for any instance of the Logger Adapter:

    export interface LogOverrideConfigI {
        // The repo to override logging for
        repo: string;
        // The level to override
        level: string;
        // The source to override logging for (optional)
        source?: string;
        // The method to override logging for (optional)
        method?: string | string[];
        // Whether inspect should show hidden properties for this override (optional)
        showHidden?: boolean;
        // The override for object depth inspect will use
        depth?: number;
    }
